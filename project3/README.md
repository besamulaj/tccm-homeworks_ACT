# Molecular Dynamics Simulation

This project implements a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program to illustrate key concepts in MD simulations. The program calculates atomic movements, potential energy, and kinetic energy and saves the simulation results to an output file for visualization.

## Features
Dynamically allocates memory for arrays
Reads atomic data (positions and masses) from input files
Calculates pairwise distances and Lennard-Jones potential
Computes kinetic energy and total energy
Implements the Verlet algorithm for integration
Outputs atomic trajectories in `.xyz` format for visualization
